Gettings started.

1 Installation
	This is based on syncframework 2.1 and can be downloaded from here
	 http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=23217

2 Configuration
	Make sure you build using correct target Platform x86 for the above Installation package. 
	Set a RemoteDirectoryPath in SyncService.svc, start the TestClient to set a localDirectoryPath.

3 Test Client Application
	The client is just a simple demonstration of functionallity, you will soon get the hang of it :)


Note
	I've used this in another project of mine, I've extracted the core sync functionallity with the basic sync features, 
	there could be some unused features in the code and a few bugs as well.
